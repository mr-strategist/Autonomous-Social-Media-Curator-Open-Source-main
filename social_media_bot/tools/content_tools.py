" "It's been three days since The Winner's New Year began.



Double work. Double Train. Double Winning.



Do you not FEEL the excitement in the air?



THE POWER??



All the losers are asleep these days, frozen in time, dreaming.



While Winners have been working.



This is why winners win and losers lose.



It has nothing to do with luck,



Nothing to do with IQ or genetics.



It is actually extremely simple.



Winners do what losers won't.



Winners work, while losers rest.



YOU are poor because you've lived most of your life as a loser.



Potentially even now.



Did you train twice today?



Worked twice as long as normal?



Or,



Are you a loser like everyone else?



Destined to the same fate as the average.



When you see the truly powerful of this world buy anything they want and shape the world.



When you see the ever-lasting DYNASTIES built and secured for entire bloodlines.



When you look at your family or friends go through hard times, unable to help them because you can barely help yourself.



I want you to understand it was entirely because of decisions made on days like today.



The days where lines are drawn.



Winners, losers.



The only difference is the decisions they make.



What decision did you make?



Double Train? Double Work?



Or did you CHOOSE to stay a loser.



"BuT TaTE, I DoNT kNoW WHaT tO Do"



I have built an entire program, designed specifically to turn the unremarkable into the remarkable within one year.



It is only open for enrollment until December 31st at 11:59 pm.



If you TRULY gave a fuck about becoming a winner, you would enroll and then never need to wonder what to do ever again.



Finance, Physical, Mental, you would be transformed in all realms.



But you already know this, you've given yourself some bullshit reason to not enroll.



"MaYbE iN 2026" you tell yourself.



Is today the day you will decide to change your life?



I doubt it.



But if it is. We begin DOUBLE WORK DOUBLE TRAINING UNLIMITED POWER AIKIDO&#x20;

"A worm exists in the dirt. &#x20;



Unnoticed and uncared for. &#x20;



Blind - unable to accurately perceive the world around him.&#x20;



Ugly and unloved.&#x20;



If you see a dead dog in the street, it sparks emotion. &#x20;



If you see a dead worm, you don't care. Nobody does.



There isn't a single fable in history which has described the valor of a worm. &#x20;



Or a worm's courage.&#x20;



In fact,



There are no stories about worms at all.&#x20;



They are insignificant to the pages of history and disappear from thought the second they are destroyed.&#x20;



Even children chop them up for fun.&#x20;



The musings of a worm are of no interest to anybody.&#x20;



Nobody cares if a worm is happy or sad.&#x20;



Watch a lion in the jungle and stare into his wizened eyes, you will wonder what he thinks.&#x20;



Nobody cares about the thoughts of a worm.&#x20;



Nobody wonders what a worm is contemplating.&#x20;



Nobody asks for the opinion of a worm.&#x20;



Nobody thinks: "What would a worm do?"



The worm is ultimately pathetic.&#x20;



On every measurable level.&#x20;



And you sir.



Are a worm.



Most perplexing of all, is that you don't even NEED to be one.



It is a choice.



You make the decision every day,



You CHOOSE to do nothing, you CHOOSE not to act.



And here I am giving you a blueprint, a path to change.



A year-long program specifically designed for the worms of the world.



You do not need motivation, you do not need discipline, you do not need any prior knowledge.



You are given a coach who will yell at you every morning to remind you of what you must do.



TO REMIND YOU TO BECOME SOMEONE OF IMPORTANCE.



You will have access to specific fitness training programs along with a fitness coach.



You will have access to over 6 different ways to make money online, each with its own coach to guide you on how to make 10s of thousands of dollars online.



You will be told what to do, exactly how to do it.



EVERYTHING TO TRANSFORM YOU FROM A WORM TO A SOMEBODY.



You have all of this for only \$49.



The program is only open for enrollment from December 26th-December 31st.



You just have to make one single decision, one year-long commitment, ONE ACT.



And you wouldn't stay a worm anymore.



You just go.



You COMMIT TO SOMETHING FOR ONCE IN YOUR LIFE and you finally become a somebody.



It requires only 1 action.



And I feel like you will, like a worm, continue to do nothing.



And you are literally only 1 action away."\
